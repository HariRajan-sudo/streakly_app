## Reverting Changes

If you want to add Shop or Notes back:

```dart
// In main_navigation.dart

final List<Widget> _screens = [
  const HomeScreen(),
  const HabitsScreen(),
  const ShopScreen(),      // Add back
  const NotesScreen(),     // Add back
  const ProfileScreen(),
];

// Add corresponding NavigationDestination items
```

## File Structure

### Active Navigation Screens

# 🔒 Habit Completion Lock Feature

## Overview
Once a habit is fully completed for the day, it cannot be checked again until the next day at 12:00 AM (midnight).

## How It Works

### Single Completion Habits (remindersPerDay = 1)
- ✅ Tap once → Habit marked complete
- 🔒 Cannot tap again until tomorrow
- ✨ Button shows solid green checkmark

### Multiple Completion Habits (remindersPerDay > 1)
- ✅ Tap 1st time → 1/3 complete (progress arc)
- ✅ Tap 2nd time → 2/3 complete (more progress)
- ✅ Tap 3rd time → 3/3 complete (solid green with checkmark)
- 🔒 Cannot tap again until tomorrow
- 📊 Shows "X/Y today" counter in subtitle

## Visual Indicators

### Not Started
- ⚪ Empty circle with gray border
- 📝 Normal text color

### Partially Complete (Multi-completion only)
- 🔵 Colored progress arcs
- 📝 Normal text color
- 📊 Shows "2/3 today" counter

### Fully Complete
- ✅ Solid green circle with white checkmark
- 🔒 Button slightly dimmed (70% opacity)
- 📝 Text may show strikethrough (in some views)
- 🎯 Green "3/3 today" counter

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Logic (`lib/providers/habit_provider.dart`)
```dart
// Check if fully completed
if (currentCount >= habit.remindersPerDay) {
  // Prevent further completions
  print('⚠️  Habit already completed for today');
  return; // Exit without changes
}

// Otherwise, increment completion
final newCount = currentCount + 1;
```

### UI Components Updated

1. **ModernHabitCard** (`lib/widgets/modern_habit_card.dart`)
   - Disables tap when `isFullyCompleted`
   - Shows completion counter (X/Y today)
   - Visual feedback with colors

2. **MultiCompletionButton** (`lib/widgets/multi_completion_button.dart`)
   - Disables tap when fully completed
   - Dims button to 70% opacity
   - Shows progress arcs or full checkmark

3. **HabitProgressCard** (`lib/widgets/habit_progress_card.dart`)
   - Uses MultiCompletionButton (inherits lock behavior)

## Reset Behavior

### Automatic Reset at Midnight
- ⏰ At 12:00 AM, the date changes
- 🔓 All habits become available again
- 📅 Previous day's completions are saved to history
- 🔥 Streak calculations update

### How Reset Works
```dart
// Date key format: "2025-01-15"
final todayKey = _getDateKey(DateTime.now());

// When date changes, todayKey changes
// getTodayCompletionCount() returns 0 for new date
// Habit becomes available again
```

## User Experience

### When Trying to Complete Again
1. User taps fully completed habit
2. Nothing happens (tap disabled)
3. Console shows: `⚠️  Habit "Exercise" is fully completed for today`
4. Optional: Show snackbar/toast (can be added)

### Success Flow
1. User taps incomplete habit
2. Button animates
3. Progress updates (arc or checkmark)
4. Counter updates (if multi-completion)
5. Syncs to Supabase database
6. Console shows: `✅ Habit "Exercise" marked complete (2/3)`

## Database Sync

### Completion Tracking
- Each completion stored in `habit_completions` table
- `completion_date`: DATE (e.g., "2025-01-15")
- `completion_count`: INTEGER (current count for that date)
- Unique constraint on (habit_id, completion_date)

### Update vs Insert
- First completion of day → INSERT new record
- Subsequent completions → UPDATE count
- Fully completed → Final UPDATE, then locked

## Testing

### Test Single Completion
1. Create habit with "Reminders Per Day" = 1
2. Tap to complete
3. Try tapping again → Should be disabled
4. Wait until midnight → Should become available

### Test Multiple Completions
1. Create habit with "Reminders Per Day" = 3
2. Tap once → See 1/3
3. Tap again → See 2/3
4. Tap third time → See 3/3 with checkmark
5. Try tapping again → Should be disabled
6. Check subtitle shows "3/3 today" in green

### Test Database Persistence
1. Complete a habit
2. Close and reopen app
3. Habit should still show as completed
4. Should still be locked until tomorrow

## Console Logging

### Successful Completion
```
✅ Habit "Exercise" marked complete (1/3)
```

### Attempt When Fully Complete
```
⚠️  Habit "Exercise" is fully completed for today. Try again tomorrow!
```

### Database Sync
```
➕ Creating habit: Exercise
   ✅ Creating in REAL Supabase
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Toast/Snackbar Feedback**
   - Show message when trying to complete locked habit
   - "Great job! Come back tomorrow to continue your streak"

2. **Countdown Timer**
   - Show "Available in 5h 23m" until midnight
   - Helps users know when they can complete again

3. **Undo Last Completion**
   - Allow undoing the last completion of the day
   - Useful if user tapped by mistake

4. **Custom Reset Time**
   - Let users choose reset time (e.g., 6 AM instead of midnight)
   - Stored in user preferences

## Benefits

✅ **Prevents Cheating**: Can't artificially inflate streaks
✅ **Encourages Consistency**: Must wait until tomorrow
✅ **Clear Feedback**: Visual indicators show completion status
✅ **Data Integrity**: One completion record per day
✅ **Realistic Tracking**: Matches real-world habit building
